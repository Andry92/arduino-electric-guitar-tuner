# arduino-guitar-tuner
Electric guitar tuner built with Arduino board. Arduino IDE Serial Plotter is used to show if strings are tuned: if input signal overlaps the reference note than the note is tuned.

MATERIALS:
- Arduino board: RobotDyn UNO CH340/ATmega328PA.
- mono Velleman preamplifier: to amplify guitar signal input.
- Step Up: to power preamplifier. Preamplifier needs voltage between 10 and 30 volt

SOFTWARE:
- Arduino IDE. Serial Plotter to see results.

I used and readapt code by amandaghassaei that you can see in this link:
